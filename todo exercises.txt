Consider buying gymnastics rings that have long belts which make it easy to change height as needed in public.

Questions:
* Does a sound workout include any/all of {sweating, high heart rate, warmup, keeping heart rate consistently high without heart rate dropping, muscle completely failed even when attempting to lift a tiny weight}?
	- If high heart rate is needed, is it possible to attain high heart rate without legs?
* How short time can a workout be and still remain sound?
	- Answer: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EmOavQTzCks can superset two exercises
* Why go to failure on different sets of the same exercise? Hasn't the muscle failed already? Even going back a [previously completed today] exercise to failure again? Do multiple failure at the same muscle increase the risk of injury?
* Lengthening (via stretching) pumped muscles during rest periods makes workout more productive?
